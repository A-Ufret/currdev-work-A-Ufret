### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
- Description: The Power On book will be read aloud to students in chunks of one chapter at a time. Teachers will revisit the lessons to teach reading strategies and have students discuss the text. Topics discussed will be connected and weaved into writing unit prompts that have cross-over connections. Students will create computer science PSA projects in Scratch or Code.org to spread awareness about CS representation, using an equity theme, from the text they connect with, as guideline for their project. 
  - Power On! themes:
    --Identity and intersectionality
    --CS Pioneers and representation
    --Racial bias in tech
    --Inequities in CS education
    --Student advocacy and social justice work
- When: Will be taught during SEL period (periods of time dedicated to social-emotional learning), Science/Computer Science period and ELA(reading/writing) periods. 
- Grades: 2-5

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
This unit will offer students explicit access to the social justice issue of inequitable representation of minorities in computer science fields. Another motivation is to create elementary level resources to make the Power On graphic novel accessible to younger students. The graphic novel format and ELA integration will serve as an entry point to helping students understand these sophisticated topics and concepts. We believe these real-world issues will empower student voice and shape change-makers/social justice activists.

### Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)
Programming
- Google CS First - will be used to build up CS skillset for students to apply to their final project 
- Use either Google CS First OR Scratch to create final project CS & Social Justice (app, game, story, or animated poster to raise awareness)
- Plickers will be used to capture data check for understanding and identify the need for small group support/conference (depending on misconception/misunderstanding and # of students with the same need)
(note: the educator can choose to substitute CS First with Code.org for CS building blocks)

9: My Impact to CS (students work on project - duration varies for students)

10: From Allies to Activists! (students share their project with the class and share how they have shared their project) - this can be done on flipgrid with students presentation video and screen recording of project.

Final Project Description: 

Students will create computer science PSA projects in Scratch or CS First to spread awareness about CS representation, using an equity theme, from the text they connect with, as guideline for their project. They will choose  platform (CS First or Scratch) and delivery system (poster(art), game, app, animated story).  
Students should include CS Concepts that we have learned throughout the unit such as: Input and Output, Variable, Function, Conditional, Loops
Note: Time for the final project to be completed will vary by student and project, you may consider having students work with a partner or small group for this section.
Class showcase: students share their project with the class and get feedback - this can be done on flipgrid with students presentation video and screen recording of project.

Instructions for Student Planning
- Include input and output (this can be buttons, clickable objects, score, text, images, etc)
- Remember to use descriptive IDs (names) for each button, backdrop, screen, image, etc
- Includes at least one variable, function, list, and conditional
- Plan out when you will use each of the following:
    - Variable
    - Function
    - Conditional 
    - Loop

### Assesments
(list summative and/or formative assessments used)
- rubric for final project
- observation rubric for teacher to record check for understanding for ELA and CS standards during lessons throughout the unit (from tiered questioning, group/partner discussions, participation etc.)
- CS projects completed on CS first will be assessments for mastery of ELA standards but evaluated as progress monitoring for CS standards with mastery of CS standards determined based on their performance by the end of the unit with the final project.
