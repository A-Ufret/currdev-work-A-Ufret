# Lesson 1 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Mini-Lesson**
Read Chapters 3-4
Reread Stop and Discuss:
What is computer science?
How is CS changing different fields? (i.e. entertainment, health care, sports, education, fashion, climate change, space exploration, etc.)
What was the counselor’s response when Christine requested to enroll into the Intro to Computer Science course?
Jon has a new ally in his Computer Science class. What do you think the role of an ally is?

**Turn and Talk:**
Why do some students lack access to computer science education? Hint: Think about the people discussed in this chapter and how different aspects of their identity affected their access to computer science.


Let’s think about some activities that we see Jon doing during this chapter. How was he an ally? (students share out)
Throughout the chapter, different characters step up in different ways to support each other. Share any way you see allyship. 

(Teacher will record answers on the board/chart paper)

**Partner/Independent work**
How can you become an ally and bring awareness to access for CS? 
Working with a partner or independently you will create a poster or remix a scratch project to bring awareness to support all students having access to CS without the fear of bullying.


**Wrap-up/Share out:**
What are different ways we can share our posters and projects to spread awareness to our school and community? 

# Lesson 2 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Read Chapter 5** 

**Re-read and stop for discussion:** 
Purpose for reading: As we re-read think about: the obstacles to accessing CS ed discussed 


The CS pioneers we are introduced to
1. On page 72, the friends are discussing how their teachers address or ignore race/ethnicity in the classroom. Why is it important to address race/ethnicity in school settings? What do you wish teachers would discuss in relation to race/ethnicity?
2. On page 73, the group talks about barriers to computer science education. Can you think of other ways computer science may not be accessible?
3. On page 76, the friends are discussing how a lack of access led to a disparity for Black swimmers. Then friends joke about Christine pursuing diving because she is half Korean, and also discuss the stereotypes that shaped Taylor’s family’s experience with swimming.  How do you think this is relevant to computer science education and careers in technology?


**Think-Pair-Share:**
In this chapter, we learned about many different figures in computer science. Which person did you most relate to or stood out to you? Why? 
What obstacles did they face?

[**Pioneer Calendar:**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19vLOICQqDf-3cWWtFeWkOlnPnTyBXPDAhetw7M_AKto/edit?usp=sharing)
Students work in pairs to explore one month of the calendar.
Share out about the pioneers for that month. 


**Wrap-Up:**
Groups of 4 work together to solve the scavenger hunt:

# Lesson 3 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Mini-Lesson:**

Frontload a review of the vocabulary with definitions

Read Chapter 1 of “Power On” book by: Jean J. Ryoo and Jane Margolis


**Partner Work:**

Have vocabulary words in a bowl and each partnership picks 1 term.

Students work in partnerships (driver/navigator) to complete the Animate a Name activity on Scratch for one of the terms and include the definition for the word in their own words.

**Share:**

Students jigsaw share out their definition.

Vocabulary words will be combined into a Scratch Studio for future student reference.


**Early Finishers:**

Sketch their character sprite plan 


#### Key Terms and Definitions

**Algorithm**
A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations especially by a computer

**Artificial Intelligence**
The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with human beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing
systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

**Bias** 
*Prejudice* 
in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.

**Ethnicity**
While this is a contested term among anthropologists, sociologists, and others, this generally refers to identification based on shared culture, where people live, language(s)
spoken, etc.

**Identity**
How one defines oneself in relation to qualities, beliefs, cultural practices, and more. This may or may not be defined according to racial/ethnic identity, gender identity, family
origins, etc.

**Latinx**
Refers to the ethnicity of people who are from or have a background in a Latin American country. Since “Latino” is a masculine adjective in the Spanish language and does not give
visibility to those who do not identify as men, the term “Latinx” was created with the intention to be inclusive of all gender identities.

**Nationality**
A legal identification of a person in international law, establishing the person as a subject,
a national, of a sovereign state. It affords the state jurisdiction over the person and affords
the person the protection of the state against other states.

**Race**
A social construct that is not rooted in science, but has been created by humans to
identify groups based on shared physical characteristics. Race does not clearly delineate
identification based on ancestry, heritage culture, etc.

**Racism**
A system that gives power to some and oppresses others based on race. It is the result of
social and institutional powers working in tandem with racial prejudice. There are different
forms of racism, for example interpersonal, internalized, institutional, and structural to
name a few. Interpersonal racism occurs between individuals. Internalized racism is when
people apply the system of power and oppression to oneself, resulting in self-hatred and
believing that one deserves to be disadvantaged. Institutional racism refers to how
policies and practices either within or across institutions favor a specific group and
disadvantages others. Structural racism involves a system of institutional practices, public
policies, and belief systems creating structures of power for some and oppression for
others.

**Racist**
Actions, measures, ideas, policies, etc. that produce and sustain that one racial group is
superior to another racial group, thereby supporting systems of power and oppression that
elevate some and oppress all others.

# Lesson 4 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Mini-Lesson**
Character Analysis
During 2nd reading of Chapter 2: Stop and Discuss
1. Where is the setting of this story?
2. What are Antonio's parents fighting about?
3. What are Antonio and Taylor going to miss about not being at the same school with Christine?
4. Why did the newsfeed make Antonio upset?
5. What is Artificial Intelligence? What are some characteristics that artificial intelligence can learn?
6. What is an algorithm?


Turn and Talk: What was the issue that Joy Buolamwini discovered in her research? What did she have to do in order for her computer to recognize her?
Highlight the stats in the text Discussion: Impressions Thoughts and Questions
The percentage of the Black and Latinx workforce in comparison to the Black and Latinx population in California:
 7% workforce vs 39% (Latinx) + 6% (Black) population 
Only 26% of the professional computing occupations are held by women, even though women make up 50% of the population. Of the 26% women in tech 7% Asian, 3% African American, 2% Latina 
Only 3% of students that are enrolled in Computer Science courses in the state of California 

**Group work:**  Describe one of the four main characters in this graphic novel. What do we know about each character so far?
Students in heterogeneous groups discuss 1 character in the book, and create a social media profile for the character on poster/chart paper (add a post-it with a ? for unknown sections about the character) 

**Independent work** - students create a sprite for the character (to have for future use)

**Share out:** Gallery walk students share feedback (and if possible add a post-it with answers for ?)
