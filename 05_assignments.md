# Lesson 1 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Mini-Lesson**
Read Chapters 3-4
Reread Stop and Discuss:
What is computer science?
How is CS changing different fields? (i.e. entertainment, health care, sports, education, fashion, climate change, space exploration, etc.)
What was the counselor’s response when Christine requested to enroll into the Intro to Computer Science course?
Jon has a new ally in his Computer Science class. What do you think the role of an ally is?

**Turn and Talk:**
Why do some students lack access to computer science education? Hint: Think about the people discussed in this chapter and how different aspects of their identity affected their access to computer science.


Let’s think about some activities that we see Jon doing during this chapter. How was he an ally? (students share out)
Throughout the chapter, different characters step up in different ways to support each other. Share any way you see allyship. 

(Teacher will record answers on the board/chart paper)

**Partner/Independent work**
How can you become an ally and bring awareness to access for CS? 
Working with a partner or independently you will create a poster or remix a scratch project to bring awareness to support all students having access to CS without the fear of bullying.


**Wrap-up/Share out:**
What are different ways we can share our posters and projects to spread awareness to our school and community? 

# Lesson 2 of Unit LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS

**Read Chapter 5** 

**Re-read and stop for discussion:** 
Purpose for reading: As we re-read think about: the obstacles to accessing CS ed discussed 


The CS pioneers we are introduced to
1. On page 72, the friends are discussing how their teachers address or ignore race/ethnicity in the classroom. Why is it important to address race/ethnicity in school settings? What do you wish teachers would discuss in relation to race/ethnicity?
2. On page 73, the group talks about barriers to computer science education. Can you think of other ways computer science may not be accessible?
3. On page 76, the friends are discussing how a lack of access led to a disparity for Black swimmers. Then friends joke about Christine pursuing diving because she is half Korean, and also discuss the stereotypes that shaped Taylor’s family’s experience with swimming.  How do you think this is relevant to computer science education and careers in technology?


**Think-Pair-Share:**
In this chapter, we learned about many different figures in computer science. Which person did you most relate to or stood out to you? Why? 
What obstacles did they face?

[**Pioneer Calendar:**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19vLOICQqDf-3cWWtFeWkOlnPnTyBXPDAhetw7M_AKto/edit?usp=sharing)
Students work in pairs to explore one month of the calendar.
Share out about the pioneers for that month. 


**Wrap-Up:**
Groups of 4 work together to solve the scavenger hunt:
