#### Lesson/Task/Assignment Description: 
Begin the discussion about accessibility by watching the film,  Among the Giants. Before showing the film, ask students to look and make a note of the accessibility barriers and solutions they see. We discuss and chart the student observations and discuss that accessibility is not only for people with a disability. Then students complete a Scavenger Hunt Activity: Introduce the activity by saying that you are going to look at how well the school works for everyone, including people with disabilities. The scavenger hunt also includes some other examples of nondisability-related access issues to help students realize that accessibility is not just a disability issue. Ask students to think about the goal of equal access as they review the selected school locations. After a concrete understanding of accessiblity we will move forward by making the connection to accessibility needs and features in technologty. Students will work in groups to explore a game or website that they like to use and find the accessiblity features they find or those that are missing. Students create a scavanger hunt for their website. We will have a carousel style share out where student rotate through the stations and them vote one which one they think is most accessible. To wrap up the unit i will use the accessibilty scoring site to score the websites they investigated to reveal the results of the most accessible and explain the scoring.

#### Lesson/Task/Assignment Description: 
Applied Digital Skills poster includes various carrers that would not usually be considered CS jobs and show how they use applied digital skills. In this lesson students learn about a range of CS skills and how they are used in all kinds of careers. After sharing the poster and introduction video, I model an example of a farmer and how they use a diverse range of CS skills to ensure that they are able to be successful. Farmers, rely on high-speed internet for modern, precision agriculture, day-to-day business transactions and overall expenditures of investment and resources. They can monitor the temperature inside barns, how much food and water is consumed. Farmers use connectivity to monitor the health of their crops, cattle, and other livestock, able to detect illness and prevent the spread of disease long before they contaminate other animals or are distributed to vendors. This not only supports the health of the population but it lowers the costs for the public, which in turn keeps them running. I model an example of creating my self portrait as a farmer and add these skills to create my own applied skills poster. Students then think about what they want to be when they grow up and research to find how they might use applied digital skills in their carrer goal. They create their own version of the applied digital skills poster on my template (with differentiated options). Students can complete this poster plugged (scratch self portrait) or unplugged by drawing their own self portait in their desired carrer goal. They add the CS skills they might use in this profession and explain how it would help them do this job better. They learn that their is a diverse range of skills and roles that use computer science to improve their work.
