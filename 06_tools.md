Tools for Communication with Parents: Class dojo & Remind
Remind is a communication platform that helps educators reach parents. Fast: Messages are sent in real-time to an entire class, a small group, or just a single person. You can also schedule announcements ahead of time and attach photos and other files.
Whole group Remind messages limited to no more than 300 characters (Pro: Parents are more likely to read the class messages, you can still attach files with the shortened message Con: To send longer messages they have to be sent to each person as a direct message).
Parents add their preferred contact method to remind, so they are guaranteed to get the message (as a text or directly in an email depending on choice).
There is also a Remind app that parents can add the class for, but they WILL get message even if they donâ€™t have the app open or installed. They do not have to create an account.
With class dojo, parents have to create an account, join the class and only get the message if they check the app or have notifications enabled on their devices. Parents that use their email for class dojo, get an email that there is an update but the email does not have the message received. They get the same email whether the update is a direct message or something shared on the class story (even if its from the school not the class). This makes it less likely that parents will get a message right away the way they would with remind.
Parents will get the message (and word docs) in the language chosen based on their device account preferences (not including image files or PDFs).
Remind does not include other features included in class dojo that can help with keeping parents in the loop with communicating with parents such as class page, assignments, portfolios, and points (positive and negative points - you can add your own categories), some students are responsive to the points system for praise/consequences.
Class dojo can be integrated into google classroom. It includes various tools for the classroom, videos for behavior & SEL, and has Mojo (character students know and recognize).
I found remind to be most effective at communication from the teachers side as well, it can be very difficult to check the app during the day (especially since notifications are not specific for direct messages), but with remind you can choose to receive texts as well, and parents have the same word count limit. As a parent or teacher, you can reply to a message with a selection of emojis (like slack but not as many options) thumbs up, check, smiley can be a great way to acknowledge receipt of a message without investing so much time in returning emails for simple updates.
Final thoughts, as communication tech tools, I think remind is much more effective at getting important information to parents quickly in a way they can understand and most reliable, in parents and teachers getting and reading messages within a short time and reply with a quick turn around (no time wasted with official responses. With the numerous additional features on class dojo, it is worth considering using this for OTHER purposes.  Meaning I do not recommend using both for communication, that just makes it more confusing. You may consider using remind for direct communication with parents about their child, class wide alerts and reminders, but able to use class dojo to share class stories (pictures, highlights, points etc).
