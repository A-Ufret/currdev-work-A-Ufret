#### DIRECTIONS
Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)


Answer the following prompts:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
Grade Level: 4
Student Experience: None - beginner (students currently have very underlying digital fluency skills - eg, don't know how to copy/paste, create a bookmark in a browser, etc).
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### What is the language?
Snap
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### How does one write & run code in this language?
Code is written by selecting from existing visual code blocks and snapping them together. Code is run by clicking the green flag.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### Rate the complexity of the syntax?
Although this may be viewed as simple for some. I think this would be quite complex for my class. Half my class are below grade level for reading. 6/24 students are at a Kindergarten reading level.
Since the blocks do have written words on them I think it might be quite tricky for many students. The higher level end of the class may be able to decode the text written on the blocks, but many have little to know CS background so may be unfamiliar with syntax of how these blocks/commands work together.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### Strengths
The blocks are color-coded and visual (eg. shape) and organized by function. The output is also very visual/graphical, which I think would appeal to younger students. There are some very cool example projects which I think could be very motivating and engaging for students.

#### How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
I would partner lower-level readers with higher level readers and/or students who may have some CS experience to support their partners.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### Weaknesses
The graphical interface, syntax and sheer number of command blocks might be daunting for students and might discourage them.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Again, I think strategic partnering would work well to mitigate the weaknesses. I also think creating a code project scaffold would be helpful. Additionally, other scaffolds such as a diagram/cheet sheet, anchor chart (labeled screenshot) could be useful aids.

#### Why did you select this language for this class?
It looks and feels very similar to Scratch and therefore I think would be appropriate for elementary level students. The other text-based languages seemed too complicated for my students. They would be way out of their zone of proximal development.
