### NEW COURSE DESCRIPTION
My dream would be to have the opportunity to create a project based learning curriculum for elementary students that covers the school year, all core content areas and integrates computer science within the standards for math, ela, science and SS. I know that when learning is in context and engaging students are able to demonstrate much higher level thinking, and are successful in demonstrating their learning through various format options. This is ideal for students at this time because there is so much variation in their academic level in all grades and classes. This would allow students to grow and learn based on their current level while also working  collaboratively to access higher level content. Students would learn how to leverage technology as a learning tool, incorporate and research their personal interests as their learn and master subject matter standards, and allow students to become independent learners and computational thinkers able to approach and solve real world problems using their strengths to approach problems in a systematic way regardless of the subject matter. This curriculum would be able to be applied to any programming platform or language as well as connect to social justice issues in their community and world to enhance student voice and agency.

### Where it fits along with the other courses in your school:
This course/curriculum would tie in with all current subjects taught (math, reading, writing, science or social studies), but allow all students to receive the differentiation they need. It would provide the time and opportunity for teachers to provide more small group and 1:1 support for students as they work on their projects. This format would also allow us to get to the point where all standards are actually addressed in the school year, since as it is right now the curricula are not designed for NYC school year and so much content is never taught leaving more and more gaps as students move up to grades where the prior learning is expected. The biggest hurdle is the time investment to design the curriculum, and administrator buy-in. So much money is wasted on curriculum that is not meeting the needs of our scholars and written for longer school days and more school days in the school year that teachers are left qwith no time to provide the differentiation and individualized learning students need now more than ever (especially in elementary grades with the COVID disruption to their learning). This would only be successful with full buy in and teachers being given the room to make instructional data driven decisions to best suppport their students. Less focus on following scrited disjointed subjects in isolation and an actual review of how these standards fit in together naturally in context would allow for much more instructional time.
